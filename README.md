The class was taught by Clark Turner at [California Polytechnic State University](http://calpoly.edu/) during Winter quarter of 2011-2012 Academic Year. The above course description was taken from [here](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~csturner/page3/page3.html).

## Abstract

> The United States House of Representatives is in the process of passing the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a bill designed to combat online copyright infringement. Reddit, the 50th most popular website in the United States, was one of 115,000 websites that participated in an online protest against these bills on January 18, 2012. SOPA would require many websites, including Reddit, to filter their content, removing links to copyright infringing websites. If these websites don't comply, they are subject to being prosecuted and shut down.

> Was the social news website Reddit ethical in blacking out their website in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act? Proponents of the bill argue that these protests were "publicity stunts" and the arguments presented by these sites were "incomplete and misleading." According the ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics, Reddit was ethical in the protest in order to warn their users that their service could potentially shut down if SOPA were to pass.
